    <h2>About FarmAid</h2>
    <p>
      FarmAid is a digital initiative that bridges the gap between farmers, donors, and markets. Our mission is to reduce crop waste, empower local communities, and build a sustainable connection between agricultural producers and consumers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through our app, farmers can easily post their surplus produce, while donors and partner organizations can purchase and deliver these goods to communities in need. This approach not only minimizes food waste but also strengthens local economies and promotes food security.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project is proudly developed by <strong>Barbielat</strong> in partnership with the <strong>Valenzuela City Agriculture Office</strong>, ensuring local farmers receive direct support through modern technology.
